    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Starting out this semester I was very new to coding and was really trying to get the hang of things with these initial exercises. With the interactive <b>2D spatial canvas</b> I wanted to experiment with a type of interactivity that ultimately became un-interactive once the blue circles were chased out of the window by the mouse. Moving from the second 2D canvas to the first <b>3D canvas</b> I wanted to explore what a dimensional translation could look like, and turned the squares into dimensional cubes. The rest of the spatial canvases were inspired color-wise by my love of matcha tea, which I drank while completing these assignments, and by my interest in levels of opacity or “fog” within the spatial canvases.

      The <b>temporal canvas</b> draws on my passion for philosophy. I wanted to emphasize global histories of philosophical movements because Eastern philosophies are so often marginalized in Western university contexts. I experimented a bit with interactivity here, but once again wanted to make sure I could understand the basics. These data are collected from Wikipedia - History of Philosophy.

        I loved working on the <b>relational network</b> and the process of diagramming a community of practice. This project took on a few different forms as I developed it alongside my final project for the Colloquium, and now has a blend of concepts of people that relate to that project in particular. I really love the interactive feel of this network and hope to continue to grow it as my capstone develops. Before the start of this program I was experimenting with using a nodal network to connect my notes through the app ‘Obsidian,’ which served as a reference when creating this canvas.

        My <b>geospatial structure</b> draws on a dataset I created for Mapping Systems. I've always admired the ornate edges of the facades in my neighborhood (Ridgewood, Queens), and am always struck when I see them at golden hour. I wanted to create a map that shows which buildings have these cornices. I found a report from the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission that describes historic buildings in Ridgewood in detail and provides year built. I took note of the year built with buildings that had cornices in the description, and filtered the Pluto NYC dataset by the Ridgewood zip code and by these years built as an approximation for buildings that will probably have this architectural detail. Here, I mapped this geojson using Mapbox.

        Lastly I developed a more conceptual <b>engagement component</b> that asks users if they are where they need to be, and opens up a follow up question once they click an answer. I wanted to pose a question that could be interpreted in a number of ways (more existential versus more matter of fact) that maintained a simple structure while I got the hang of using Firebase.
